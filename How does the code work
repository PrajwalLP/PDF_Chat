How it works 

1) We load the PDF on the website 

2) The Loaded PDF is then converted into Chunks 

3) These Chunks are embedded 

4) These Embedded Chunks are the Fed to the backend vector where it is stored

5) User Query/Question is taken and checked 

6) We get the similarity and then the answer is produced 

7) The Chat History is also taken into account
